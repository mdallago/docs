* **Mining engine**
    * We have all the tools necessary to mine BCH, BTC and LTC.

* **Multi-coin support**
    * We provide support for BCH, BTC and LTC.

* **RPC Support**
    * We are developing full RPC support, to be compatible with software that currently relies on other BCH, BTC and LTC implementations.

* **Multi interface**
    * Our platform supports multi-language programming:C, C++, Go, Python, Node, C\# and others.


Besides our developers team we also work on understanding every part of the bitcoin protocol, including the mathematics that make bitcoin and others cryptocurrencies possible. Our efforts can be divided in two categories:

**Modelling:** In order to understand how bitcoin works, a thorough knowledge of the protocol itself is not sufficient without using mathematical models to analyze certain parts of its behaviour, especially under attacks or exceptional circumstances.

**Research:** The crypto community is a very active one, so in addition to conducting our own research, we have to keep up with all the papers and new ideas coming up, analyze them and assess their value.
